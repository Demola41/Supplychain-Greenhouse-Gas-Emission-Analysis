# Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis
<a href="https://github.com/Demola41/Supplychain-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Analysis/blob/main/Supply%20Chain%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emission.png">[Dashboard Preview]</a>
## 1. Situation
Analyzed environmental impact data across **1,016 industries** to measure the carbon footprint of global supply chains, specifically tracking CO2 equivalent emissions per 2021 USD.
## 2. Task
The goal was to identify high-emission sectors and perform efficiency assessments by correlating economic margins with emission factors to pinpoint where environmental impact is highest relative to economic value.
## 3. Action
Utilized **Power BI** to visualize Emission Factors (EF) and margin impacts.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Created rankings to contrast the Top 10 carbon-intensive industries against the Bottom 7.
* **Metric Calculation:** Calculated averages to isolate the specific impact of margins on total emissions.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Highest Emitter:** The dashboard identified **"Solid Waste Landfill"** as the highest emitter, generating **10.99 kg CO2e/USD**.
* **Key Driver:** Analysis revealed that economic margins contribute significantly to the total emission profile, rather than just raw production volume.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Audit Prioritization:** Sustainability audits should prioritize the **Solid Waste** and **Cement Manufacturing** sectors.
* **Impact Reduction:** Focusing on these two industries yields the highest ROI for carbon reduction efforts per dollar spent.
